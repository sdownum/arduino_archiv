Eclipse Support
===============

This repository can be imported into Eclipse Juno CDT, using a combination of the
standard Arduino IDE and the Arduino Eclipse Plugin. To learn more about the 
plugin and installation instructions, visit the following:

http://www.baeyens.it/eclipse/

Following the install instructions provided there will get you from nothing to a
fully operational Arduino development environment, using Eclipse.

Currently, once the project is imported into Eclipse, you can change the build 
configuration to build different programs. Currently, there is only build support
for no_quarter. Eventually, all sub-projects will have their own Eclipse
build configuration.
