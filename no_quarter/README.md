==========

This is a sketch for LED control. Right now it just strobes. The plan
is to have a python-based utility to generate and upload a LED control
sketch based on submitted arguments. Optionally, the sketch itself could take arguments from the serial monitor. 

This can be built as a sketch using the Arduino IDE and the .ino file, or build with
Eclipse and the Arduino Plugin, building against the .cpp file. 


Of course, this is a #wip.
