/*
no_quarter
==========

This is a sketch for LED control. Right now it just strobes. The plan
is to have a python-based utility to generate and upload a LED control
sketch based on submitted arguments. Optionally, the sketch itself could take 
arguments from the serial monitor. 

Of course, this is a #wip. 

Yes, this is currently just blink from Arduino.cc


This file is just a stub for the Arduino IDE. The implementation is 
found in no_quarter.cpp
