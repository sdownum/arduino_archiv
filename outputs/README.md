========

Randomly makes an array of LEDs twinkle for random durations.

Besd on sketches for Chapter 2 from the OSEPP "Arduino Companion" book,
*Arduino Basics*.

The ultimate goal is to make this sketch the base template for *La Fee Verte* 
lantern project.

This can be built as a sketch using the Arduino IDE and the .ino file, or build with
Eclipse and the Arduino Plugin, building against the .cpp file.
