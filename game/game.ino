game
====

A game of timing with an array of LEDs and a switch.

This goal is to press the switch when the green LED is lit. The more times
you succeed, the faster the LEDs flash.

Besd on sketches for Chapter 4 from the OSEPP "Arduino Companion" book,
*Arduino Basics*.

This can be built as a sketch using the Arduino IDE and the .ino file, or build with
Eclipse and the Arduino Plugin, building against the .cpp file.

This file is just a stub for the Arduino IDE. The implementation is 
found in outputs.cpp
